\chapter{Introduction}
In this project, we designed and constructed two types of capacitors: a parallel-plate capacitor and a cylindrical capacitor. We then designed experiments to measure the capacitance of these capacitors and compared the results with theoretical calculations. Additionally, we investigated the behavior of capacitors in circuits, including their response to triangular wave input and their charge dynamics in series circuits. Also learned how to effectively use oscilloscope and function generator to measure the voltage and current in the circuits.
