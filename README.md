# Integrated Project#1 - Capacitor Design & Measurement

Project files for the first integrated project of the ESD Capsule at Abdullah Gül University, Spring 2024.

In this project, we designed and constructed two types of capacitors: a parallel-plate capacitor and a cylindrical capacitor. We then designed experiments to measure the capacitance of these capacitors and compared the results with theoretical calculations. Additionally, we investigated the behavior of capacitors in circuits, including their response to triangular wave input and their charge dynamics in series circuits. Also learned how to effectively use oscilloscope and function generator to measure the voltage and current in the circuits.

This project consists of 3 parts:

- **PHYS104 & MATH154:** Theoretical calculations of capacitance is done and designed the capacitors according to these calculations.
- **EE201:** Designed the circuits and measured the capacitance of the capacitors using an oscilloscope and function generator. The results were compared with the theoretical calculations.
- **EE201 & MATH154:** Derived the triagnle wave fourier series and fed the circuit with a triangular wave input. Measured the output voltage and current of the circuit using an oscilloscope and function generator. Then applied FFT to the output voltage and current signals to analyze the frequency response of the circuit.

**NOTE:** Please note that the calculations on the report may not be accurate, as the project was done in my freshman year and I was not very familiar with the concepts at that time. I want to keep this project as a reference for my future self and for anyone who may find it useful.
